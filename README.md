**Birthday GIFt Project**

This project was created through a learning on Scrimba.com as part of the frontend developer path. 
The inention of creating this was to help familiarize/hone my skills with CSS and HTML basics. When hovering over the "GIFts", a gif should come up and play appropriately without any issues. All elements should be well placed and centered accordingly. I am aware that the profile image at the top is more of an oval shape as opposed to the preferred circle shape. I did this due to the resolution of the photo provided to me by my friend for this project. Had I stuck with the tranditional shape of the circle, the picture would have looked "squished".

In order to run this project locally, you will need to clone the repository, and run the npm install in the bash / command line. Once you have run npm install, you will need to run npm run dev in the bash / command line.

**The only dependency you may need for this is Babel**
